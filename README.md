# Rafael Bastos
I have always been passionate about technology, statistics, and math. As an economist, I also got involved with econometrics and developed an interest in finance and the stock market.

Since I graduated I had a couple of jobs in financial institutions, having worked at the Brazilian Development Bank for the last years. As a consequence, I started to realize the tremendous amount of data being processed daily.

This background combined with a craving for developing new skills naturally led me to dive deep into programming and into the field of Data Science.

**Background in** Python, Machine Learning, Statistics, Econometrics
